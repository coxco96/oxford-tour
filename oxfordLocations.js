      "Oxford is an academic fairytale land brought to life. The University of Oxford is sprawled throughout the city of Oxford. The university is made up of 45 colleges and registered halls, each with their own sort of miniature campus. Lectures happen all over the city, and each of Oxford's colleges has its own library, dining hall, and living quarters. Tutors, as professors are called, often live in community within the college they are part of. <br> The University of Oxford is the second oldest university in the world, with evidence of teaching as early as 1096 (over 900 years ago).<br> However, Oxford wasn't always what it is today. Women were not permitted to study at Oxford until 1878 and could not earn degrees until 1920. It wasn't until 1974 that every college permitted women's admission. Now, though, Oxford has a roughly equal gender spread.<br>The map you see was drawn by cartographer <a href='https://collections.leventhalmap.org/search/commonwealth:3f4632472'>Nathaniel Whittock</a> in 1850. While much has changed in Oxford since then, many of its rich historic sites remain in their same locations, still thiriving in the city's ceaseless thirst for knowledge and understanding.<br>Click the buttons below to take a virtual tour of some of Oxford's historic sites--or, feel free to explore the map on your own using the numbered locations on the bottom of Whittock's map.",
